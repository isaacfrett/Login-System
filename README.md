# Login-System
Python project using Django framework to create an account creation and login system.

This project builds out a register page and a login page that work together to take user information and store it for the user to be able to log in to view certain pages.
This will also send the new user an automated email test message for signing up, similar to an autoamted welcome messasge most sites would send.
The system also prevents logged in users from accessing the register and login sites and restricts them to the home page. Vice versa the users who are not logged in can only see the register and login sites and not the home page.
The home page is simple html heading with the navbar showing the username and logout button.
The register and login sites use a previous styling template in javascript but the html and styling were edited to my liking.

Below are some screenshots of each page for register, login, and the homepage.
